# GreenBot

Greenbot is a middleware server for bots, connecting all kinds of bots to all kinds of networks. If you are a bot developer, Greenbot will make sure that you don't have to integrate all one hundred messaging networks. Messaging networks won't have to on-board one bot at a time.   

Greenbot does all kinds of good stuff:
* **Session Management**: Greenbot keeps track of messaging sessions, when a conversation starts, when it ends, what was said. Errr. Texted
* **Collect Data**: Greenbot supports bots that collect structured data from bots, then saves and webhooks that data to external services. 
* **Routing**: Greenbot connects keywords to bots, and allows bots to transfer to other bots.
* **Language Translation**: Greenbot translates between human languages, so when you text in with French, but the prompts are in English, it will restart the bot conversation with correct language. Slick.
* **All Kinds Bots**: Greenbot currently supports simple script bots, bot-kit bots, and Watson Dialog bots. More kinds of bots coming all the time.
