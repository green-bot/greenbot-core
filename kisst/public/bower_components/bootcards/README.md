**Why Bootcards?**

We think Cards are the design pattern for mobile of the future. The near future that is. Cards are appearing already on sites and apps like Twitter, Google Now, Facebook, Spotify, Pinterest, and Amazon. To kickstart your (and our) projects we decided to create Bootcards.

The current version of Bootcards is stable, but always work in progress. We built a demo app showcasing what the framework (and your apps) can look like using NodeJS.
