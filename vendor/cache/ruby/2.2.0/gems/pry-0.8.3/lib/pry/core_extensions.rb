    # Start a Pry REPL.
    # This method differs from `Pry.start` in that it does not
    # support an options hash. Also, when no parameter is provided, the Pry
    # session will start on the implied receiver rather than on
    # top-level (as in the case of `Pry.start`).
    # It has two forms of invocation. In the first form no parameter
    # should be provided and it will start a pry session on the
    # receiver. In the second form it should be invoked without an
    # explicit receiver and one parameter; this will start a Pry
    # session on the parameter.
    # @param [Object, Binding] target The receiver of the Pry session.
    # @example First form
    #   "dummy".pry
    # @example Second form
    #    pry "dummy"
    # @example Start a Pry session on current self (whatever that is)
    #   pry
    def pry(target=self)
